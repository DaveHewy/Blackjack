<p>Welcome to PHP Blackjack v1.0. PHP Blackjack is a fully customisable drop in replacement for any PHP based system wishing to benefit from player vs dealer blackjack games. PHP Blackjack currently only supports single players versus dealer but support for player v player is being considered for the future.</p>

<p>Whilst making PHP Blackjack, we've tried to focus on making it very developer friendly, attempting to make it perfect for any MMORPG or Browser Based Game owner to incorporate into their systems.</p>
